The server is subject to failure due to a disaster arrival, which can occur while the server is turned on and not only when it is busy. At a failure instant, the server is turned off and its repair process begins. During the repair process, two models are considered. For both models, we present the PGF and the expected number of clients in the system in the steady state.},

These nonstationary chains possess infinite invariant measures, making the estimation problems associated with them particularly intricate.This thesis delves into several estimation problems in the context of β-null recurrent Markov chains, providing new insights and methodologies to tackle these challenges. Our first contribution is the proposal of a tail index estimator for generalized discrete Pareto distributions, which is then used to estimate the parameter β in atomic β-null recurrent Markov chains. The second contribution involves the adaptation and validation of the Regeneration-based bootstrap and Regenerative Block bootstrap methods for these types of chains. Lastly, we develop an estimator for monotone functions in nonlinear cointegrated models, where the underlying process is a Harris recurrent Markov chain (positive or β-null recurrent).},

  abstract = {It is the main purpose of this article to extend the notion of statistical depth to the
              case of sample paths of a Markov chain, a very popular probabilistic model to describe
              parsimoniously random phenomena with a temporal causality. Initially introduced to
              define a center-outward ordering of points in the support of a multivariate
              distribution, depth functions permit to generalize the notions of quantiles and
              (signed) ranks for observations in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with $d>1$, as well as statistical
              procedures based on such quantities, for (unsupervised) anomaly detection tasks in
              particular. In this paper, overcoming the lack of natural order on the torus composed
              of all possible trajectories of finite length, we develop a general theoretical
              framework for evaluating the depth of a Markov sample path and recovering it
              statistically from an estimate of its transition probability with (non-) asymptotic
              guarantees. We also detail its numerous applications, focusing particularly on anomaly
              detection, a key task in various fields involving the analysis of (supposedly) Markov
              time-series (\textit{e.g.} health monitoring of complex infrastructures, security).
              Beyond the description of the methodology promoted and the statistical analysis carried
              out to guarantee its validity, numerical experiments are displayed, providing strong
              empirical evidence of the relevance of the novel concept we introduce here to quantify
              the degree of abnormality of Markov path sequences of variable length.},

               of  estimating the regularity index $\beta>0$ of a discrete
               heavy-tailed r.v. $S$, \textit{i.e.} a r.v. $S$ valued
               in $\mathbb{N}^*$ such that $\mathbb{P}(S>n)=L(n)\cdot n^{-\beta}$
               for all $n\geq 1$, where $L:\mathbb{R}^*_+\to \mathbb{R}_+$
               is a slowly varying function. Such discrete probability laws, referred to as
               generalized Zipf's laws sometimes, are commonly used to
               model rank-size distributions after a preliminary range
               segmentation in a wide variety of areas such as
               \textit{e.g.} quantitative linguistics, social sciences
               or information theory. As a first go, we consider the
               situation where inference is based on independent copies
               $S_1,\; \ldots,\; S_n$ of the generic variable $S$. The estimator
               $\widehat{\beta}$ we
               propose can be derived by means of a suitable
               reformulation of the regularly varying condition,
               replacing $S$'s survivor function by its empirical
               counterpart. Under mild assumptions, a non-asymptotic
               bound for the deviation between $\widehat{\beta}$ and
               $\beta$ is established, as well as limit results
               (consistency and asymptotic normality). Beyond the
               i.i.d. case, the inference method proposed is extended
               to the estimation of the regularity index of a
               regenerative $\beta$-null recurrent Markov chain. Since
               the parameter $\beta$ can be then viewed as the tail
               index of the (regularly varying) distribution of the
               return time of the chain $X$ to any (pseudo-)
               regenerative set, in this case, the estimator is
               constructed from the successive regeneration times.
               Because the durations between consecutive regeneration
               times are asymptotically independent, we can prove that
               the consistency of the estimator promoted is preserved.
               In addition to the theoretical analysis carried out,
               simulation results provide empirical evidence of the
               relevance of the inference technique proposed.},
